# Basic and Intermediate Challenge for ICP AI HackerHouse

Welcome to this tutorial that is for people to get started into ICP, a decentralized cloud built on blockchain technology. Architected for being general purpose, the only limit you have is your imagination. üôÇüöÄ

On this challenge, the main goals are:

- to introduce to IC, showcasing great examples of what is already possible
- to help you getting started in a quick but still effective way
- to hopefully convince you the IC stack and ecosystem is a great place to have a Dev career or co-found a startup.

## Challenge Overview

This challenge will be in Motoko. We have prepared a Codespace for you, so you don't waste time on local setup and can go directly to the fun part, coding! ‚å®Ô∏è

In the basic challenge you will:
- Develop a canister (backend) that logs in with Gmail, with an ICP wallet provider called NFID.
- Work on the backend, understanding data structures, packages, stable/dynamic memory, etc.
- You will allow to setup a user profile and safely store user records (like the results of the AI Model).

In the intermediate challenge you will:
- Connect that backend to the API of HuggingFace, using IC HTTP Outcalls.
- We will use a basic one, phrase sentiment analysis model.
- You will need to parse the response and more clearly show the model result.
- Then on the frontend you need to improve it and allow the user to interact with the new AI / API features you just added.

## Submission Details & Requirements

For getting the 50 (only basic) or the 100 (basic + intermediate) ckUSDT prize, you will need to:
- Join the Taikai platform (where we publickly handle all the submissions): https://taikai.network/icp-portugal/hackathons/ICP-AI-HACKERHOUSE
- Create a project, following the instructions on the video, namely:
  - Title saying "Easy Challenge - Your Name" or "Intermediate Challenge" if it's the case.
  - Add your github that allows to see the code finishing the challenge.
  - A video recording of the Candid UI (Basic Challenge) or the Frontend (Intermediate Challenge) showing the dApp behaving as expected on the challenge.

# General Instructions / Commands

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# On a new tab start the replica, it will be important for logs
dfx start

# On previous tab, deploy your canisters to the replica and generate your candid interface
dfx deploy

# For getting the right Codespace links, you can run this script
./scripts/canister_urls.py
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at the links provided (be aware of copying the query params to the Codespace machine url!).

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:3000`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.
